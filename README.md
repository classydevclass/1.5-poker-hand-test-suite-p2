# Poker Hand Test Suite
Welcome to the poker hand test suite! This TypeScript app will let you build a deck of cards and deal 2 cards to as many players as desired.

## Pre-Requisites
You will need TypeScript installed in order to use this app.

```js
npm install -g typescript
```

You will also need to rebuild TypeScript after making any changes before running the code.

```js
tsc -p LOCAL_PATH/poker-hand-test-suite/tsconfig.json
```

## Running The App
Each runthrough will build a deck and deal 2 cards to 2 players. The results are logged in your console.

```js
node index
```

## Running Tests
To run the test suite, simply run npm test.
```js
npm test
```

## Future Use
These builder files will be used in a larger poker app within other repos.
